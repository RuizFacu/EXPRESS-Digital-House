This autumn I started a course of Web Programming at Digital House, a well-know school in Argentina.

This course was my way of getting into this whole new world for me and I have really enjoyed it.

In my different repositories you will find the practice I have done to become a Web Developer.

In EXPRESS Digital House  you will find my learning an Express server set up.
